### Step 3: Use Agents in Your SwiftUI Projects

To use an agent, type `/agents` and select the appropriate specialist:

**Example 1: Adding Animations**
```
You: I want to add smooth animations to my SwiftUI button interactions
You: /agents
[Select shake-it-off from the list]

shake-it-off: I'll analyze your SwiftUI Views for animation opportunities.
[Analyzes your View structure]
- Found tap interactions that need animation feedback
- Button state changes could benefit from spring animations  
- Navigation transitions could be smoother

Here's how to enhance your interactions...
```

**Example 2: Design Consistency Audit**
```
You: My app's typography and spacing feels inconsistent across screens
You: /agents
[Select style from the list]

style: I'll audit your entire app's design system.
[Performs comprehensive style analysis]
- Found 12 different font sizes (recommend 6 standardized sizes)
- Inconsistent button padding across 8 components
- Missing semantic color usage in 15 locations

Here's your detailed consistency report...
```

**Example 3: Building Onboarding**
```
You: I need to create an onboarding flow for my fitness app
You: /agents
[Select welcome-to-new-york from the list]

welcome-to-new-york: I'll create your onboarding experience.

Let me ask a few questions first:
- How many onboarding screens do you need?
- What permissions does your fitness app require?
- Should users be able to skip the flow?

Based on your answers, I'll create a polished onboarding flow...
```
